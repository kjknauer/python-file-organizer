# Python File Organizer

## Overview
This script automatically organizes files in a folder by sorting them into subfolders based on file type. I built this project to practice Python basics and learn how automation can help with IT support tasks.

## Skills Practiced
- Python fundamentals
- File handling
- Automation
- Problem-solving

## What I Learned
- How to work with the `os` and `shutil` modules
- How to loop through files in a directory
- How automation can save time in IT support

## How to Run It
1. Install Python
2. Save the script in a folder with random files
3. Run the script
4. Watch your files get sorted automatically

## Future Improvements
- Add a GUI (graphical interface)
- Add logging
- Add more file categories
